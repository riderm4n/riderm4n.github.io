**About this website?** This web actually a media to me to write anything. Since I code a web for living, this site also my place for my experiment. This site is powered by <strike>wordpress</strike> [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}. The theme is designed by myself. You can fork it [here](https://github.com/riderm4n/riderm4n.github.io){:target="_blank"}. The design inspired by [nicolasgallagher.com](http://nicolasgallagher.com/){:target="_blank"}, [minimallyminimal.com](http://www.minimallyminimal.com/){:target="_blank"}, [blog.penso.info](http://blog.penso.info){:target="_blank"}, and the biggest impact is the lazy and simple version of me.

**About me?** I code for living, big fan of super heroes, kamen riders, listen to music, and most of all, I love my wife Nevya Rizawa. See the detail [here](faq.html).
